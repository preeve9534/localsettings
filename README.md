# localsettings

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/victronenergy/localsettings.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/victronenergy/localsettings)

[Venus OS](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki) implements
a D-Bus service ```com.victronenergy.settings``` (the 'settings service')
for management of any application's persistent (that is non-volatile)
data or settings.

Giving a central service control over persistent settings means that
applications are relieved of the burden of managing their non-volatile
data.
It also means consistency: there is one place to see all the settings;
one process maintaining a log of settings changes (under
/log/localsettings/); and one mechanism for resetting all settings to
factory-default.

If you are writng a program that creates a new D-Bus service then
you must use the settings service to acquire a unique DeviceInstance
number for your service.

If you are writing a program of any sort that needs to maintain its
own persistent data or requires access to the persistent data of other
programs then the settings service must be used as a proxy for all
such access.

At the time of writing, a Python library provides an interface to the
settings service.

### D-Bus API

```com.victronenergy.settings``` exposes the following API.

### AddSetting

There are two usage patterns.

In both cases, a setting already exists in Venus OS then the AddSetting()
call will simply be ignored.

The first pattern must be used by an application which wants to create
a D-Bus service in order to obtain a unique, perhaps already existing,
VRM instance number to be used as the service's /DeviceInstance property
value.

### AddSetting(*path*, *pair*)

Create a new, persistent, service identifier.

*path* must be a string of the form
"/Settings/Devices/*service-name*/ClassAndVrmInstance",
where *service-name* is an arbitrary value, but it makes sense if it
ties into the name you will use when you create your service.

*pair* is a string of the form "*class*:*vrm-instance*", where *class*
is the name of your service class ("battery", "tank" or whatever) and
*vrm-instance* is a proposed VRM instance number.

AddSetting will check if *path* exists and if so do nothing.

If *path* does not exist, and the proposed *vrm-instance* value is unused
within *class* then *pair* will be used as the value of *path*.
If, on the other hand, *vrm-instance* is already in use, then path will be
assigned the value "*class*:*unique*" where *unique* is a system assigned,
guaranteed unique, VRM instance number.

Returns 0 on success or a negative error value (see AddSettingError
in the source for details).

On success, the calling application can recover the value of *path*,
extract the second field of the returned pair and use this as the value
of the new service /DeviceInstance property.

### AddSetting(*groupname*, *settingname*, *initialvalue*, *type*, *min*, *max*)

Add a persistent setting to Venus OS.

*groupname* specifies the group under which the setting should be
created. For example "/Settings/MyApp".

*settingname* is the name of the setting and can be a path if settings
need to be organised hierarchically. For example "/StartMode".

*initialvalue* is the value to be used if the specified setting
does not already exist.

*type* is the data type of the setting ("s" says string, "i" says
integer, "f" says float) and this must conform with the value supplied
for *initialvalue*.

*min* and *max* can be used to introduce validation thresholds for
numeric types that will be applied when the specified setting is updated.
Setting both *min* and *max* to 0 will prevent any validation checks.

The full D-Bus path of the new setting is formed by concatenating
*groupname* and *settingname* (interpolating a '/' if required).
If the composite setting path already exists then the call to AddSetting()
is ignored.

Returns 0 on success or a negative error value (see AddSettingError
in the source for details).

### AddSettings

Batch process the creation of persistent settings.
This call is somewhat more convenient and efficient than multiple repeated
calls to AddSetting().

save some dbus method call allows to add multiple settings at once which
saves some roundtrips if there are many settings like the gui has.

Unlike the AddSetting, it doesn't make a distinction between groups
and setting and only accepts a single path. The type is based on the
(mandatory) default value and doesn't need to be passed. min, max and silent
are optional.

Required parameters:
- "path" the (relative) path for the setting. /Settings/Display/Brightness when called \
  on / or /Display/Brightness when called on /Settings etc.
- "default" the default value of the setting. The type of the default values determines \
  the setting type.

Optional parameters:
- "min"
- "max"
- "silent" don't log changes

For each entry, at least error and path are returned (unless it
wasn't passed). The actual value is returned when no error occured.

Commandline examples:

```
dbus com.victronenergy.settings / AddSettings \
'%[{"path": "/Settings/Test", "default": 5}, {"path": "/Settings/Float", "default": 5.0}]'

[{'error': 0, 'path': '/Settings/Test', 'value': 1},
 {'error': 0, 'path': '/Settings/Float', 'value': 5.0}]

or on /Settings:

dbus com.victronenergy.settings /Settings AddSettings \
'%[{"path": "Test", "default": 5}, {"path": "Float", "default": 5.0}]'

[{'error': 0, 'path': 'Test', 'value': 1},
 {'error': 0, 'path': 'Float', 'value': 5.0}]

or for testing:

dbus com.victronenergy.settings /Settings/Devices AddSettings '%[{"path": "a/ClassAndVrmInstance", "default": "battery:1"}, {"path": "b/ClassAndVrmInstance", "default": "battery:1"}]'
[{'error': 0, 'path': 'a/ClassAndVrmInstance', 'value': 'battery:1'},
 {'error': 0, 'path': 'b/ClassAndVrmInstance', 'value': 'battery:2'}
```

#### RemoveSettings
Removes all settings for a given array with paths

returns an array with 0 for success and -1 for failure.

#### GetValue
Returns the value. Call this function on the path of which you want to read the
value. No parameters.

#### GetText
Same as GetValue, but then returns str(value).

#### SetValue
Call this function on the path of with you want to write a new value.

Return code:
*  0 = OK
* -1 = Error

#### GetMin
See source code

#### GetMax
See source code

#### SetDefault
See source code

## Usage examples and libraries
### Command line
Typical implementation in your code in case you want some settings would be:

1. Always do an AddSetting in the start of your code. This will make sure the setting
exists, and will not overwrite an existing value. Example with commandline tool:

    dbus -y com.victronenergy.settings /Settings AddSetting GUI Brightness 50 i 0 100

    In which 50 is the default value, i the type, 0 the minimum value and 100 the maximum value.
2. Then read it:

    dbus -y com.victronenergy.settings /Settings/GUI/Brightness GetValue

3. Or write it:

    dbus -y com.victronenergy.settings /Settings/GUI/Brightness SetValue 50

4. dbus com.victronenergy.settings /Settings AddSettings \
'%[{"path": "Int", "default": 5}, {"path": "Float", "default": 5.0}, {"path": "String", "default": "string"}]'

5. dbus com.victronenergy.settings /Settings RemoveSettings '%["Int", "Float", "String"]'

Obviously you won't be calling dbus -y everytime, but implement some straight dbus
interface in your code. Below are some examples for different languages.

### Python

To do this from Python, see import settingsdevice.py from velib_python. Below code gives a good example:

Somewhere in your init code, make the settings:

    from settingsdevice import SettingsDevice  # available in the velib_python repository
    settings = SettingsDevice(
        bus=dbus.SystemBus() if (platform.machine() == 'armv7l') else dbus.SessionBus(),
        supportedSettings={
            'loggingenabled': ['/Settings/Logscript/Enabled', 1, 0, 1],
            'proxyaddress': ['/Settings/Logscript/Http/Proxy', '', 0, 0],
            'proxyport': ['/Settings/Logscript/Http/ProxyPort', '', 0, 0],
            'backlogenabled': ['/Settings/Logscript/LogFlash/Enabled', 1, 0, 1],
            'backlogpath': ['/Settings/Logscript/LogFlash/Path', '', 0, 0],  # When empty, default path will be used.
            'interval': ['/Settings/Logscript/LogInterval', 900, 0, 0],
            'url': ['/Settings/Logscript/Url', '', 0, 0]  # When empty, the default url will be used.
            },
        eventCallback=handle_changed_setting)

Have a callback some where, in above code it is handle_changed_setting. That is how
you'Äºl be informed that someone, for example the GUI, has changed a setting. Above
function has this definition:

    def handle_changed_setting(setting, oldvalue, newvalue):
        print 'setting changed, setting: %s, old: %s, new: %s' % (setting, oldvalue, newvalue)


To read or write a setting yourself, do:

    settings['url'] = ''


Or read from it:

    print(settings['url'])

### QT / C++
todo.

### C
todo.

## Running on a linux PC
It is also possible to run localsettings on a linux PC, which may be convenient for testing other
CCGX services.

The localsettings script requires python dbus, gobject and xml support (for python 2.7). On a
debian system install the packages python-dbus, python-gobject and python-lxml.
